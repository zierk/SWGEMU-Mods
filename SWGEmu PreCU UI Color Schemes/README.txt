SWGEmu New PreCU UI Color Schemes [Update 05/31/12] by Kayliaah

---------------------------------------------------------------

To install:
Drag and drop the ui folder into the SWGEmu root directory.
You should now see more options in the in-game options menu under Interface


### NOTE: The ui_styles.inc has modified the icons for Jedi attacks and have added some Infinity specific
icons in this package. If you use this version of the mod on non-infinity servers, you will likely have missing
icons on some attacks.

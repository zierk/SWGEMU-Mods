Borrie's Better Lightsabers, ft. Revan Dark
Version 1.0

DESCRIPTION:
Sometimes the simple weight of the weapon you're using can mean all the difference to a game's feel. These hilts, both new and adapted from a fantastic mod for JKA by Revan Dark in 2005, brings that weight to the Lightsabers of the game by giving them high detail meshes.

INSTALLATION:
Drag and drop the Contents of one or both subfoldrs in the Borrie's Better Lightsabers folder into your active SWGEmu install. This is the folder that contains your SWGEmu.exe.

Install the contents for "Hilt Models" to install the higher resolution models and textures. 

Install the contents for "Blade Mods" to install new effects for Lightsaber blades to be more movie accurate, as well as new epic sounds for lightsaber ignition, deactivation, and idle.

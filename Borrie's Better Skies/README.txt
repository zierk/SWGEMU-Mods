Borrie's Better Skies
Version 2.0

DESCRIPTION:
Star Wars Galaxies' Skies have always suffered from one thing: The textures used for the clouds were woefully low resolution. A natural element of being a game of its age, but unfortunately it does help highlight the lower quality of the graphics in general.

This mod is twofold. It first replaces the cloud textures with higher resolution, higher quality sky textures. The second part is replacing the environment color maps to be more vibrant and detailed, giving the sky a richer and more diverse visual flavor that can enrich the environmenmt greatly. 

PATCH 1.1:
-Fixed an issue with Tatooine's sky gradient having a bright white color underneath the horizon.
-Corrected a naming issue which was causing at least one of the cloud textures from several planets not being appropriately replaced. This will signifigantly increase the quality of skies. 

PATCH 2.0:
-Added new shaders that fade out the edge of the cloud layer in order to remove the hard edge of the clouds against the sky. Special thanks to Sytner for figuring out the math and method required to fade out the texture at a distance.

INSTALLATION:
Drag and drop the texture folder inside "Borrie's Better Skies" folder into your SWGEmu base folder. This is the folder that contains your SWGEmu.exe.
